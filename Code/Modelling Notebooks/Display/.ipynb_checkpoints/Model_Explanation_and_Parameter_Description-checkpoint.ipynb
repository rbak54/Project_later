    "    - increasing the duration of contact means that more shedding happens overall (a), so V increases\n",
    "    - however as the duration of contact increases, there is also more decay of the virus.\n",
    "    - a is not dependent on V but b is. The higher V is, the more the decay rate has to \"act on\".\n",

    "- this assumes that infection probability per contact is determined by viral titre per infected individual in the environment and that $\\frac{dV}{dd}=a-bV$. It seems likely that the change viral titre in the environment is determined by the shedding rate and the rate of decay multiplied by amount of virus. However how this corresponds to infection is more uncertain and this is definitely a simplification of the processes that lead to infection. It assumes that viral load is important for the likelihood of infection (true? look for evidence) but it also assumes that fomites are the major cause of viral transmission, which is unlikely (ref). Respiratory droplet contact with mucus membranes are likely to be a key source of infection and aerosol transmission may play a role. These are unlikely to be described by the dynamics described here. \n",
    "    - Respiratory droplets- role of humidity? - but mostly just the closeness and time of contact. probably proportional to the overall duration of contact.\n"
